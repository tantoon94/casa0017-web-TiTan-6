# For Developers
> Attention! Developers on Win!

As Docker is mandatory required for this project, u need to download Docker on your Computer(Laptop). But pls donot install Docker on the Win directly, or it might destory the environment of your computer. 

I know you guys don't want to totally change your computer into linux (by completely reinstalling the computer). 

So, use the virtual machines on your computer(through Hyper-V) is highly recommended for developing this project.

> Attention! Developers on Win!

##  Before U start the project
To be honest, there are too many details to pay attention to even the most basic configuration of virtual machines and Docker. Here I will only list the steps you must (and recommend) before starting the project, as well as some of the problems that are difficult to find solutions.
### Step 1. Download Hyper-V from Chorme/Edge/Firefox
    Pls search on the internet or even ask GPT, pls donot ask me.
### Step 2. Download .iso file for Ubuntu 22.04.5 Desktop (recommended): 
    https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/
Using the .iso you download from the web to creat a virtual machine through Hyper-v. 

Pls, choose "US" for your keyboard !!!

### Step 3. How to adjust the resolution of virtual machine (Ubuntu 22) in Hyper-V:

**Modify the grub file in Ubuntu system**
```
sudo vi /etc/default/grub
```
Find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and modify it to:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash video=hyperv_fb:<width x height>". 
```
Here, change <width x height> to the appropriate resolution of your computer, such as 1920x1080.

Then, run the commands below:
```
sudo update-grub
sudo apt install linux-image-extra-virtual
```
Final step, close the Ubuntu virtual machine.

**Setup Hyper-v**

After closing the Ubuntu virtual machine, you can view the virtual machine name in the Hyper-V Manager. Replacing vm-name with your own virtual machine name.  Replace <2560> <1600> with your own screen resolution, such as 1920x1080.

Start PowerShell in administrator mode and run the following command:

    set-vmvideo -vmname <vm-name> -horizontalresolution:<2560> -verticalresolution:<1600> -resolutiontype single

    set-vm <vm-name> -EnhancedSessionTransportType HVSocket 


### Step 4. Install Docker Engine (also docker-compose) on Unbuntu 22.04 (or other linux sys)
    Pls search on the internet or even ask GPT, pls donot ask me.

### Step 5. For Chinese Developers Only
Install Pinyin input method through Fcitx5 in Ubuntu and set it to start automatically at boot
    Pls search on the internet or even ask GPT, pls donot ask me.

## Build and Run

**Run with Docker Compose:**

    Start all services using docker-compose (I prefer the first one):
    
    sudo docker-compose up --build
    
    sudo docker-compose up -d

**Force rebuild all services and start**  
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

**Stop with Docker Compose:**

    sudo docker-compose down
